# NyxOS Filesystem & VFS

How NyxOS names, stores, and serves files. The virtual filesystem lives in
[`kernel/fs/vfs.c`](../kernel/fs/vfs.c), the on-disk driver in
[`kernel/fs/ext2.c`](../kernel/fs/ext2.c). This complements
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (whole-system view) and
[PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md) (per-process cwd and fd tables).

---

## 1. One namespace, several backends

Everything hangs off a single root `/`. Four kinds of thing live in that tree:

```
/                       ramdisk (in-memory tree of vfs_node_t)
├── bin, etc, home, …   ramdisk files and directories
├── dev/                synthetic device nodes  (null, zero, random)
├── proc/               generated kernel state   (meminfo, uptime, <pid>/…)
└── mnt/                a real EXT2 disk, auto-mounted at boot
```

The VFS resolves a path, decides which backend owns it, and dispatches. The
ramdisk is the default; `/mnt` is backed by a real EXT2 partition; `/dev` and
`/proc` are computed on the fly.

---

## 2. The node pool

Every ramdisk file or directory — and every transient mirror of a mounted-FS
file — is a `vfs_node_t` drawn from a fixed pool:

```c
#define MAX_INODES   512   // total node pool
#define MAX_CHILDREN 128   // entries per directory
```

Key `vfs_node_t` fields ([vfs.c](../kernel/fs/vfs.c)):

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `name`, `type` | name and 0=file / 1=dir |
| `size`, `data` | length and the in-memory bytes (ramdisk files) |
| `parent`, `children[]`, `child_count` | the tree structure |
| `open_refs` | how many live fds point here — the pool must not recycle a node anyone still holds |
| `orphaned` | unlinked from the tree while still open; freed at the last close |
| `mount_backed`, `mpath`, `mount_ent`, `dirty` | a transient node mirroring an EXT2 file, and whether it has unflushed writes |
| `dev_type`, `proc_type`, `proc_pid` | `/dev` special or generated `/proc` node |

---

## 3. File descriptors

A VFS "fd" **is a pointer to a `vfs_node_t`** — there is no separate open-file
table at the VFS layer. `open_refs` reference-counts it: +1 on `open`, +1 per
`dup`, −1 per `close`, and the node is returned to the pool only at zero. This is
what stops the pool from handing the same memory to a new file while an old fd is
still live. Ring-3 processes never see these raw pointers: the syscall layer wraps
them in small per-process integer fds (see [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md) §8 and
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

The public API ([kernel.h](../kernel/core/kernel.h)):

```c
int vfs_open(path, flags, mode);   // flags: O_CREAT (1), O_TRUNC (2). O_APPEND (4) is defined
                                   // but not honored — vfs_write REPLACES the whole file (no
                                   // per-fd position); use vfs_pwrite to append or stream.
int vfs_read(fd, buf, count);      int vfs_write(fd, buf, count);
int vfs_pread(fd, buf, count, off);int vfs_pwrite(fd, buf, count, off);
int vfs_close(fd);
int vfs_stat(path, *size, *is_dir);int vfs_isdir(path);
int vfs_mkdir(path, mode);         int vfs_unlink(path);
int vfs_chdir(path);               const char* vfs_getcwd(void);
int vfs_mount(mount_point, fs_type, fs_data);
```

## 4. Path resolution and the working directory

Each process carries an absolute, normalised `cwd` (see [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md)).
A relative path is joined onto it and the `.`/`..` segments are collapsed by
`join_mount_relative` — the canonicaliser pinned by the `pathnorm` self-test and
exposed to userland as [`realpath`](../kernel/fs/vfs.c) (`vfs_realpath`). Two
subtleties worth knowing:

- **`vfs_abs` normalises only relative-under-mount paths**; an already-absolute
  path with `.`/`..` is returned unchanged. Use `vfs_realpath` when you need a path
  with `..` in it fully collapsed.
- **`..` can never escape root** — stacked `..` past `/` stays at `/`. This
  containment is a property the `pathnorm` KAT verifies explicitly.

Because a mounted directory has no ramdisk node, `mount_dir_stub()` builds a chain
of lightweight stub nodes so `getcwd()` and `cd ..` keep working while the CWD is
somewhere under `/mnt`.

---

## 5. The EXT2 driver

`/mnt` is a **real, read/write EXT2 filesystem** on a disk partition, auto-mounted
at boot (`mount_table` holds up to `MAX_MOUNT_POINTS = 8` mounts). The driver
([ext2.c](../kernel/fs/ext2.c)) implements the parts a working Unix FS needs:

- **Variable block size** — 1 KiB, 2 KiB, or 4 KiB (`1024 << s_log_block_size`),
  read from the superblock.
- **Direct, singly-indirect, and doubly-indirect** block maps, so files grow well
  past the 12 direct blocks; sparse files (holes) are handled.
- **Superblock, group descriptors, inode tables, and block/inode bitmaps** for
  allocation, with a small set of reusable per-purpose block buffers (a general
  block, a bitmap block, and two auxiliary blocks — the doubly-indirect walk needs
  two live at once).
- **RTC timestamps** on inodes (`ext2_now`), so `mtime`/`dtime` are real and
  `e2fsck` doesn't flag "deleted inode has zero dtime".

**Write batching (v6.4.10).** A mounted file's writes only mark its mirror node
`dirty`; the whole file is flushed to disk once, at the **last close**. The
earlier flush-on-every-`write()` re-wrote the entire file per 4 KiB chunk — O(n²)
I/O that made the ~496 KiB in-OS `tcc` object take minutes. Now it is linear.

---

## 6. Special filesystems

**`/dev`** — synthetic device nodes whose reads/writes bypass `node->data`:

| Node | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `/dev/null` | reads return EOF; writes are discarded |
| `/dev/zero` | reads return endless zero bytes |
| `/dev/random`, `/dev/urandom` | reads return cryptographically-secure random bytes from the kernel CSPRNG (`csprng_bytes`); `urandom` is an alias. (This replaced an earlier tick-seeded xorshift64, whose output was predictable.) |

**`/proc`** — kernel state generated on read (nothing is stored):
`meminfo`, `uptime`, `version`, `cpuinfo`, `mounts`, and a per-process
`/proc/<pid>/` directory with `status`, `cmdline`, and `maps`. `proc_sync()`
creates and removes the per-pid directories to track the live process table.

---

## 7. The command surface

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `tree` | browse the tree |
| `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc` | read file contents |
| `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv` | create / remove / copy / move |
| `find`, `grep` | search by name / content |
| `stat`, `file`, `du`, `df` | metadata, type, disk usage, free space |
| `realpath` | canonical absolute path |
| `mount`, `disks`, `lsblk`, `ext2ls`, `ext2cat` | mounts and raw EXT2 inspection |

Plus the userland coreutils in [`user/`](../user) (`ls`, `cp`, `dd`, `od`, `xxd`, …).

---

## 8. Limits and non-goals

- **`MAX_INODES = 512`** ramdisk nodes and **128** children per directory — fixed
  pools, no dynamic growth. Sustained in-OS compilation used to exhaust the node
  pool (issue #66, since resolved); the 256→512 bump gave it headroom. The pools
  are still bounded, so a pathological workload could in principle refill them.
- **No `truncate`/resize primitive** — files grow by writing; there is no VFS call
  to shrink or set an exact size yet.
- **No symlinks and no permission enforcement** — the mode argument is accepted but
  access is not gated on it; `..` containment (not per-file ACLs) is the security
  boundary here. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **At most 8 mounts**, and only one EXT2 partition is auto-mounted at boot.

NyxOS is an experimental system; the filesystem favours a small, auditable core
over completeness.
