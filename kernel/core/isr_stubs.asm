; The `cld` is a SECURITY requirement, not tidiness. RFLAGS.DF is part of ring 3's
; state and survives into the handler: a user program can execute `std` and then
; simply wait for a timer interrupt. Every rep-string in the kernel would then run
; BACKWARDS — and memcpy_asm/memset_asm in stubs.asm are exactly `rep movsb` /
; `rep stosb`, so essentially every copy and clear in the kernel would walk down
; through memory instead of up. The SysV ABI also requires DF clear on entry to
; any C function, so compiler-emitted string ops assume it too.
;
; The `syscall` path is already covered by IA32_FMASK (syscall.c clears IF and
; DF); interrupts and exceptions were not covered by anything. Putting it in this
; macro covers every entry path that saves state — irq_common, isr_common and
; ap_timer_stub — in one place, so a new stub cannot forget it.

; LSTAR is the higher-half alias of this label, so RIP is in the higher half and

; all user GPRs onto the kernel stack with NO scratch register, before touching
; CR3. (The previous version clobbered RAX/RBX during the CR3 switch *before*
; SAVE_REGS, corrupting the syscall number and the user's RBX/RSP.)

    ; GS is how we reach per-CPU state with NO free register — the one thing the
    ; hardware gives us here. Each core's IA32_GS_BASE holds the HIGHER-HALF alias
    ; of its own cpu_info slot (cpu_install_gs_base), so these accesses resolve
    ; under the user CR3 too, through the PML4[511] mirror.

    ; NO swapgs, deliberately. The textbook discipline is to swap GS on every
    ; ring transition, and it is wrong for this kernel: irq_common enters from a
    ; process in ring 0 and can iretq into a DIFFERENT process in ring 3, so the
    ; swaps would not pair — the next `syscall` would then compute gs:0 and write
    ; to address 0. Instead GS_BASE simply stays pointed at the per-CPU block in
    ; both rings. That is safe here precisely because NyxOS gives userspace no GS
    ; base of its own (no TLS, no arch_prctl, CR4.FSGSBASE off), and ring 3 still
    ; cannot read the block: the linear address it computes lands on a supervisor
    ; page and faults.

    ; the syscall switches to user itself before its iretq" then resumes us on the
    ; KERNEL CR3 — but we have ALREADY done our switch and will not repeat it. The
    ; `push 0x1B / iretq` below then returns to ring 3 on the kernel CR3, and the

    ; Why the window is reachable at all: syscall ENTRY masks IF via SF_MASK, so a
