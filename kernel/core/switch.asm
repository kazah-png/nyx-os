; CURRENTLY UNUSED — the preemptive scheduler switches through irq_common's
; saved_rsp/next_rsp instead. Kept because create_task_stack's frame layout is
; the reference the process.c stack builders are written against.
;
; It also USED TO BE BROKEN: it pushed 14 registers and popped 15, so resuming a
; context this function had saved consumed the return address as if it were RAX
; and `ret` jumped to whatever sat above it. It only ever appeared to work
; because the one frame it was fed came from create_task_stack, which lays out
; 15 slots. The `push rax` below restores the symmetry; do not remove it without
; removing a pop as well.
